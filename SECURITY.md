Security Policy for Project Citadel
The security of this project and the safety of our users' data is our highest priority. We deeply appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a high standard of security.

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us privately. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.


Supported Versions
We are committed to providing security updates for the latest stable release of the project. Please ensure you are testing against the most recent version available in the main branch.

Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to saurabhmishra.24x@gmail.com.

When submitting your report, please include the following details to help us resolve the issue as quickly as possible:
- Description: A clear and concise description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Reproduction Steps: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability. This is the most important part of the report.
- Proof-of-Concept (PoC): If possible, provide a PoC, such as a script or a sample vault file that triggers the vulnerability.
- Environment: The operating system, Python version, and any other relevant environmental details.
- Contact Information: Your name or alias for public credit, and a way for us to contact you.


What to Expect
After you submit a report, we will do our best to:
1. Acknowledge Receipt: Respond to your report within 48 hours.
2. Initial Triage: Confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity. We will keep you updated on our progress.
3. Remediation: Develop a patch for the vulnerability.
4. Coordinated Disclosure: Work with you to coordinate a public announcement of the vulnerability once a fix is available and has been distributed. We believe in responsible disclosure.
5. Give Credit: Publicly credit you for your discovery on our README.md and in the release notes, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.


Scope
Any reproducible vulnerability that affects the security of the application's core logic, cryptographic implementation, or data handling is likely to be in scope.

Out of Scope
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (please report them to the respective project maintainers).
- Attacks requiring physical access to an unlocked device.
- Attacks requiring the user's master password.
- Attacks requiring the user to run the application on a compromised operating system (e.g., with a keylogger installed).
- Social engineering attacks.


Bug Bounty Program
At this time, we do not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we are immensely grateful for all contributions and will ensure that all researchers who report valid issues are properly credited.

Thank you for helping keep Project Citadel secure.

# üìñ Project Citadel: User Guide

Welcome to Project Citadel! This guide will walk you through the installation, setup, and basic usage of the Citadel command-line interface (CLI).

---

## üíª 1. Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have **Python 3.9 or higher** installed on your system.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following commands to clone the project from GitHub and navigate into the directory.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/citadel.git](https://github.com/your-username/citadel.git)
cd citadel
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file. It's a good practice to do this inside a virtual environment.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are now ready to use Project Citadel! All commands will be run using `python citadel.py`.

## üöÄ 2. Getting Started: Your First Vault

The first step is to create a secure vault to store your passwords and other secrets.

### Creating a Vault
The `init` command creates a new, encrypted vault file. You'll be prompted to create and confirm a Master Password.

```bash
python citadel.py init --vault ./my_secrets.db
```
After running this, a new file named `my_secrets.db` will be created. This is your encrypted vault.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Note:**
> Your Master Password is the single key that protects all your data. Choose a strong, unique password that you can remember. **If you forget your Master Password, your data will be permanently inaccessible.** There is no recovery process.

---

## üîë 3. Core Commands

Here is a reference for the most common commands. For all commands, you'll need to specify the path to your vault file using the `--vault` flag.

### Adding an Entry
Use the `add` command to store a new password in your vault.

-   **Add an entry with a password you choose:**
    You will be prompted to enter and confirm the password securely.
    ```bash
    python citadel.py add --vault ./my_secrets.db --title "Gmail" --username "user@example.com"
    ```

-   **Generate a secure password automatically:**
    The `--generate` flag will create a strong, random password for you.
    ```bash
    python citadel.py add --vault ./my_secrets.db --title "Reddit" --username "my_user" --generate
    ```

### Listing Entries
The `list` command shows the titles and unique IDs (`item_id`) of all entries in your vault.
```bash
python citadel.py list --vault ./my_secrets.db
```
**Example Output:**
```
[item_id]                              [Title]
------------------------------------   -------
f7b1c3d4-e5f6-a7b8-c9d0-e1f2a3b4c5d6   Gmail
a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a7b8-c9d0-e1f2a3b4c5d6   Reddit
```

### Showing an Entry's Details
To view the full details of a specific entry (including the password), use the `show` command with the entry's `item_id`.
```bash
python citadel.py show f7b1c3d4-e5f6-a7b8-c9d0-e1f2a3b4c5d6 --vault ./my_secrets.db
```

### Copying a Password to the Clipboard
The `copy` command securely copies a field to the clipboard. For your security, the clipboard will be automatically cleared after 20 seconds.
```bash
python citadel.py copy f7b1c3d4-e5f6-a7b8-c9d0-e1f2a3b4c5d6 --field password --vault ./my_secrets.db
```

### Changing Your Master Password
If you need to change your Master Password, use the `change-master` command. You will be prompted for your old password and then asked to create and confirm a new one.
```bash
python citadel.py change-master --vault ./my_secrets.db
```

## üõ°Ô∏è 4. Security Best Practices

-   **Back Up Your Vault**: Your vault is a single file (e.g., `my_secrets.db`). Make sure to create regular backups of this file and store them in a secure, separate location (like an encrypted external drive). If you lose this file, you lose your data.
-   **Keep Your Master Password Safe**: Do not write down your Master Password or store it in a digital format. Memorize it. Do not share it with anyone.
-   **Lock Your Computer**: Always lock your computer (e.g., `Win+L` or `Cmd+Ctrl+Q`) when you step away to prevent unauthorized physical access.

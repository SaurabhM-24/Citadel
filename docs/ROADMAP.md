# Project Citadel: Development Roadmap

## Introduction

This document outlines the development roadmap for Project Citadel. Our goal is to build a secure, user-friendly, and trustworthy password manager through a phased, iterative approach.

This roadmap is a living document and may be adjusted based on community feedback, technical challenges, and project priorities.

## Phase 1: Foundation (In Progress) üß±

The primary goal of this phase is to build a robust and secure foundation for the entire project. The focus is on creating a fully functional, local-first command-line tool that can be used as a daily driver.

### Key Milestones

-   [ ] **Core Cryptographic Library:** A stable, well-tested library in Python that handles all encryption, decryption, and key derivation logic.
-   [ ] **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A feature-complete CLI for all essential vault operations (init, add, show, copy, export, etc.).
-   [ ] **Secure Vault Format v1:** Finalize and document the v1 vault file format specification.
-   [x] **Core Documentation:** Publish initial project documentation, including the `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and technical specifications.
-   [ ] **Vault Migration Tools:** Develop scripts for importing data from other password managers or standard formats (e.g., CSV).

## Phase 2: Desktop & Initial Synchronization üíª

This phase focuses on expanding beyond the CLI to a graphical user interface and introducing the first iteration of cross-device synchronization.

### Key Milestones

-   [ ] **Desktop GUI Application:** A cross-platform desktop application (e.g., using Tauri) that provides a user-friendly graphical interface for managing the vault.
-   [ ] **Initial Sync Mechanism:** Implement a file-based synchronization option, allowing users to sync their encrypted vault file using their own cloud storage provider (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud).
-   [ ] **TOTP Multi-Factor Authentication:** Add support for Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) as a second factor for unlocking the vault.
-   [ ] **Hardened Core Library:** Begin porting the core cryptographic library to a language like C++ or Rust for better performance and memory control, ensuring full compatibility with the v1 vault format.

## Phase 3: The Ecosystem üåê

This is the long-term vision for Project Citadel, transforming it into a complete, cross-platform password management ecosystem with a dedicated, secure sync service.

### Key Milestones

-   [ ] **Dedicated Sync Server:** Develop and deploy a zero-knowledge sync server to provide a seamless, real-time synchronization experience across all clients.
-   [ ] **Mobile Applications:** Native mobile apps for both iOS and Android with OS-level integration (e.g., biometric unlock).
-   [ ] **Browser Extension:** A browser extension for major browsers (Chrome, Firefox) with secure, user-initiated autofill capabilities.
-   [ ] **Advanced MFA (Device Approval):** Implement innovative, sync-integrated MFA, allowing users to approve new devices from existing, trusted ones.
-   [ ] **Formal Security Audit:** Engage a reputable third-party firm to conduct a full security audit of the entire ecosystem.
-   [ ] **Team & Shared Vaults:** Introduce features for securely sharing secrets and vaults among family members or teams.

We are excited about the future of Project Citadel and look forward to building it with the help of the open-source community.
